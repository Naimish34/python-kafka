This is a basic example of how using requests library we fetch data from  a website and then publish data using kafka producer and then consume those messages using kafka consumer.both of them are written in python3.
also make sure that you install kafka library so that your producers/consumers may work as we need.
go to command line the type : "python3 webc.py"
then open another command line terminal then type : "python3 webp.py"
you will see data being fetched from a sample website and then published and being consumed in a that order.
